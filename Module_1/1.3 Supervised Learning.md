## 🧠 Supervised Learning Overview

**Supervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. The goal is to learn the relationship between input features and their corresponding labels, enabling the model to predict outputs for new, unseen data.

## 🏷️ Classification Algorithms 📊

In **Classification**, the task is to predict a **categorical label** for each input.

### 🚀 Key Algorithms for Classification:
- **Logistic Regression**: Simple binary classification, such as predicting spam vs. not spam.
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like structure that splits data to predict a class.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by averaging predictions.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Predicts the class based on the majority class of nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes**: Based on probability theory, often used for text classification like spam detection.

### 📝 Example: Predicting Spam Emails 📧
- **Task**: Classify whether an email is **spam** or **not spam**.
- **Training Data**: A labeled dataset of emails with tags "spam" or "not spam."
- **Algorithm Example**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes.
- **Prediction**: The model classifies a new email as either spam or not.

## 📈 Regression Algorithms 🔢

In **Regression**, the goal is to predict a **continuous value** based on input features.

### 🚀 Key Algorithms for Regression:
- **Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between input features and a continuous target.
- **Ridge Regression**: Adds regularization to linear regression to avoid overfitting.
- **Lasso Regression**: Like Ridge but also performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
- **Decision Trees (for Regression)**: Tree-based method that can predict continuous values.
- **Random Forest (for Regression)**: Ensemble of decision trees used to predict continuous outputs.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: SVM for regression tasks, tries to fit the error within a threshold.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**: Predicts continuous values based on the average of nearest neighbors.

### 📝 Example: Predicting House Prices 🏡
- **Task**: Predict the **price** of a house.
- **Training Data**: A dataset of house features (size, location, number of rooms) and their prices.
- **Algorithm Example**: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression.
- **Prediction**: The model predicts the price of a new house based on its features.
