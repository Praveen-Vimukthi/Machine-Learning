# 🚀 Machine Learning Types: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning 🤖

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Types** repository! This repo introduces three major types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning** 📊
2. **Unsupervised Learning** 🧠
3. **Reinforcement Learning** 🏆

## 1. **Supervised Learning** 📈

### 🔍 What it is:
In **supervised learning**, the model is trained on **labeled data**. For every input, the correct output (label) is already provided. The model learns the relationship between inputs and outputs to make accurate predictions on new data.

### 📝 Example:
**Task**: Predict whether an email is **spam** or **not spam** 📧

- **Training Data**: The model is trained on a dataset of emails that are tagged as either "spam" or "not spam."
- **Prediction**: After training, the model can predict whether a new incoming email is spam or not, based on its content.

## 2. **Unsupervised Learning** 🧐

### 🔍 What it is:
In **unsupervised learning**, the model is trained on **unlabeled data**. The goal is to find **patterns** or **groupings** in the data without predefined labels.

### 📝 Example:
**Task**: Group customers based on their buying behavior 💳

- **Data**: The model receives customer data (e.g., purchases, spending habits) without labels.
- **Prediction**: The model identifies patterns and groups customers into segments, such as "high spenders," "frequent buyers," and "occasional shoppers."

## 3. **Reinforcement Learning** 🎮

### 🔍 What it is:
In **reinforcement learning**, an **agent** learns by **interacting** with its environment. The agent receives **rewards** or **penalties** based on its actions, and the goal is to maximize the **total reward** over time.

### 📝 Example:
**Task**: A robot learning to walk 🤖

- **Training**: The robot tries moving in different ways. If it moves correctly (steps forward), it gets a **reward**. If it falls, it gets a **penalty**.
- **Prediction**: Over time, the robot learns to move in ways that maximize its reward (staying upright and walking).
