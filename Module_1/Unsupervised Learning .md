# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning

Welcome to the **Unsupervised Learning** section of Machine Learning! Unlike supervised learning, here we work with **unlabeled data** and try to find **patterns or structures** hidden inside.

## 📚 What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data **without any labels**. The goal is to explore the structure of the data and uncover meaningful patterns, groupings, or relationships.

## 🧩 Types of Unsupervised Learning

### 🔹 1. Clustering

Groups data into clusters based on similarity.

- **📌 Example**: Segmenting customers into groups like "loyal", "new", and "occasional" shoppers.
- **✅ Algorithms**:
  - K-Means
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN

---

### 🔹 2. Dimensionality Reduction

Reduces the number of features while preserving key information.

- **📌 Example**: Compressing a dataset with 100 features into just 2 or 3 for visualization.
- **✅ Algorithms**:
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  - t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
  - Autoencoders

---

### 🔹 3. Association Rule Learning

Finds rules or relationships between items in large datasets.

- **📌 Example**: Market Basket Analysis 🛒
  - Rule: If a customer buys bread 🍞 and butter 🧈, they often buy jam 🍓 too.
- **✅ Algorithms**:
  - Apriori
  - Eclat
  - FP-Growth
