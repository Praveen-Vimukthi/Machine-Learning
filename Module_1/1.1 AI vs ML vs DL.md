## üìò Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks that would typically require human intelligence. AI involves programming machines to perform tasks such as problem-solving, reasoning, language processing, and decision-making.

### Key Points:
- AI is the umbrella term for **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**.
- It includes any technique that enables machines to simulate human behavior.

## üìä Machine Learning (ML)
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. ML systems automatically improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data, without the need for explicit programming.

### Key Points:
- ML algorithms learn from **data patterns**.
- It involves supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

## üß† Deep Learning (DL)
**Deep Learning (DL)** is a subset of Machine Learning that uses **neural networks** with many layers (hence, "deep"). It is primarily used for processing large datasets and performing tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and language translation.

### Key Points:
- Deep Learning uses **neural networks** to mimic human brain function.
- It's powerful for **high-dimensional data** like images and videos.
