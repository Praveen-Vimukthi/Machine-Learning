## 🧠 Non-Intelligent vs Intelligent Systems

Before diving into AI, it's important to understand the **difference between non-intelligent systems and intelligent systems**.

### 📦 Non-Intelligent Systems
- Follow pre-programmed rules.
- Do not learn or adapt.
- Output is always fixed for the same input.
- Examples: Basic calculators, washing machines with fixed cycles.

### 🤖 Intelligent Systems
- Can make decisions based on input and context.
- Learn from data or experience.
- Adapt to new or unknown situations.
- Examples: Self-driving cars, recommendation engines.

## 📘 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the science of building systems that can perform tasks which typically require human intelligence.

### Key Points:
- AI is the umbrella for **ML** and **DL**.
- AI includes decision making, language understanding, vision, etc.

## 📊 Machine Learning (ML)

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn patterns from data and make predictions.

### Key Points:
- ML improves with data.
- Includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

## 🧠 Deep Learning (DL)

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a specialized branch of ML that uses deep neural networks.

### Key Points:
- Uses multiple layers (deep networks).
- Works well with large datasets (images, video, text).
