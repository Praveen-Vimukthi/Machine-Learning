# 📊 NumPy - Numerical Python

This repository contains a complete tutorial on the **NumPy** library in Python, designed for efficient numerical computations. NumPy is foundational for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

---

## 🚀 Advantages of NumPy Arrays

- Perform mathematical operations easily
- Faster computation compared to Python lists
- Consumes less memory and provides powerful broadcasting

---

## ⏱️ List vs NumPy - Performance Comparison

We compare how long it takes to perform operations using a regular Python list vs a NumPy array using the `process_time()` function.

---

## 📐 NumPy Array Creation

Covers how to create arrays using:

- `np.array()`
- `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.full()`
- `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`

---

## 🔄 Array Indexing and Slicing

Learn how to access and manipulate data in arrays using indexing and slicing, similar to Python lists but with extra features for multi-dimensional data.

---

## 🧮 Array Operations

Explore how to perform element-wise operations such as:

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
- Trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms
- Aggregate functions like `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`

---

## 🔧 Reshaping and Resizing Arrays

Includes:

- `.reshape()` for changing array shape without changing data
- `.flatten()` to convert multidimensional array to 1D

---

## 🧱 Stacking and Splitting

Demonstrates:

- Vertical and horizontal stacking using `vstack()`, `hstack()`
- Splitting arrays into smaller sub-arrays with `split()`

---

## 🎭 Boolean Masking and Advanced Indexing

Apply conditions directly on arrays to filter or modify data, useful in data analysis tasks.

---

## 🎲 Random Module in NumPy

Use `numpy.random` to generate:

- Random numbers
- Random integers
- Shuffling arrays
- Setting seed values for reproducibility

---

## 🧠 Practice Examples

End of the tutorial includes practice problems for applying all learned concepts.

---

## 📎 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

Install NumPy via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
