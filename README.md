# Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** journey! 🚀

In this repository, I explore the fascinating world of **Machine Learning (ML)**—the science of enabling computers to learn from data, improve over time, and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming.

## 🌟 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that involves training models on data to make predictions, discover patterns, and solve complex problems. Instead of manually programming every step, ML allows systems to learn from examples and adapt over time.

## 💡 Why Machine Learning?

From recommendation systems (think Netflix & YouTube) to autonomous vehicles, **ML** is changing how we interact with technology daily. In this repository, you'll find various ML algorithms, hands-on projects, and the journey of understanding how to build and fine-tune models to make accurate predictions.

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered:

- **Supervised Learning**: Teaching models with labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training models through trial and error (e.g., game AI).
- **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural networks that mimic human brain structure.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics to gauge how well your models perform.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used:

- **Python**: The backbone of most machine learning projects.
- **Scikit-learn**: A powerful library for building ML models.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building neural networks.
- **Pandas / NumPy**: Essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualization tools to present data insights.
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive ML applications.

## 🗓️ Weekly Breakdown:

This repository follows a **24-week roadmap** where I cover a wide range of topics—from basic ML concepts to advanced algorithms like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and more. Each week, I’ve implemented code, solved problems, and updated the repo with new concepts and projects.
