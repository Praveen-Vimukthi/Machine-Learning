# Standardization in Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

In Machine Learning, **data preprocessing** is crucial for model performance.  
**Feature Scaling** ensures numeric features are on a similar scale.  

This repository focuses on **Standardization**, a method to scale features.

## 📝 What is Standardization?

Standardization rescales numeric features so they have:

- **Mean (μ) = 0**
- **Standard Deviation (σ) = 1**

It helps models converge faster and perform better when features have vastly different ranges.

Mathematically, it is represented by the **Z-Score formula:**: 

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

Where:

- $$X\$$ = original value  
- $$\mu$$ = mean of dataset  
- &sigma;  = standard deviation  

**Key Points:**

- Values roughly lie between **-1 and 1**.  
- Maintains relative differences between values.  
- Improves training for models like **Gradient Descent-based models**.

## 📊 Example Dataset
We will use this dataset:

```python
dataset_1 = [1, 99, 789, 5, 6859, 541, 94142, 7, 50826, 35464]
dataset_0 = [10, 5, 6, 1, 3, 7, 9, 4, 8, 2]  # x-axis
```

### 📈 Step 1 — Compute Mean and Standard Deviation
```python
n = len(dataset_1)
mean = sum(dataset_1) / n
variance = sum([(x - mean)**2 for x in dataset_1]) / n
std_dev = variance**0.5

print("Mean: ", mean)
print("Standard Deviation: ", std_dev)
```
**Output:**
```
Mean: 18873.3
Standard Deviation: 30578.18
```

### 📏 Step 2 — Standardize (Z-Score)
```python
z_scores = [(x - mean) / std_dev for x in dataset_1]

print("Original | Z-Score")
for original, z in zip(dataset_1, z_scores):
    print(f"{original:8} | {z:.5f}")
```
**Output:**

| Original | Z-Score |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1        | -0.62   |
| 99       | -0.62   |
| 789      | -0.61   |
| 6859     | -0.40   |
| 541      | -0.62   |
| 94142    | 2.45    |
| 50826    | 1.05    |
| 35464    | 0.55    |


### 📊 Step 3 — Plot the Original Data
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(dataset_0, dataset_1, color='blue', marker='*', s=60)
plt.title("Original Values")
plt.xlabel("Index")
plt.ylabel("Values")
plt.show()
```
