# 📊 LANL Earthquake Prediction - Kaggle Dataset Setup

This guide shows you how to install the Kaggle API, configure authentication, download the **LANL Earthquake Prediction** dataset, and extract it for use.

---

## 🧰 1. Install the Kaggle API Library

Install the Kaggle Python library, which allows your code to communicate with Kaggle and download datasets.

```bash
!pip install kaggle
```
---

## 🔐 2. Configure Your Kaggle API Key

To access Kaggle data, you must use an API key. Follow these steps:
- 1.  Go to your Kaggle account settings: [https://www.kaggle.com/account](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
- 2.  Scroll down to the "API" section and click **"Create New API Token"**
- 3.  A file named kaggle.json will be downloaded.

```bash
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle  # Create the .kaggle directory
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/  # Move the kaggle.json file to the correct location
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json  # Set file permissions (very important for security)
```
---

## 📥 3. Download the Dataset

Use the Kaggle API to download the dataset by competition name(provide in site):

```bash
!kaggle competitions download -c LANL-Earthquake-Prediction
```
> 🔒 These steps ensure your key is private and secure.

---

## 📂 4. Extract the Dataset

Once downloaded, extract the .zip file using Python's zipfile module:

```python
from zipfile import ZipFile

# Set the path to the downloaded zip file
dataset = "/content/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction.zip"

# Extract all files in the zip archive
with ZipFile(dataset, 'r') as zip:
    zip.extractall()
    print("The Dataset has extracted")
```
