## 🔍 Importance of Data in ML

Data is the fuel of machine learning. The success of any ML model is directly dependent on the quality and quantity of the data it's trained on. Clean, diverse, and relevant datasets help models generalize better and perform more accurately in real-world scenarios.

> “Better data beats fancier algorithms.” — Peter Norvig

## 🌐 Where to Collect the Data?

Here are some popular and effective methods to collect machine learning datasets:

- **Public Datasets**:
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
  - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)

- **APIs**:
  - [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
  - [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

- **Web Scraping**:
  - Tools: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
  - Make sure to check the site's `robots.txt` and terms of service.

- **Manual Data Collection**:
  - Surveys, experiments, user inputs.
