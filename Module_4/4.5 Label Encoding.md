# Label Encoding in Machine Learning

Label Encoding is a data preprocessing technique in Machine Learning used to convert categorical values into numerical labels. Since most ML algorithms work only with numeric data, categorical features must be encoded before model training. In Label Encoding, each unique category is assigned an integer between 0 and the number of classes.

The labels are assigned in alphabetical order not based on their position in the dataset which is why encoded values may appear non-sequential when viewed top-down in a DataFrame.
