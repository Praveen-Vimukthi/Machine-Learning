# What is Train–Test Split?

Imagine this 👇

You are studying for an exam.

- You learn from a book → this is training
- Then you take a test → this is testing

In **Machine Learning**, it is the same idea.

👉 We split the data into two parts:

- Training data → to teach the model
- Testing data → to check how well it learned

This is called Train–Test Split
